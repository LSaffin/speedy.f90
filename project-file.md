Hi, my name is ${USER}.

This is a project which I wrote. This file will provide the documents. I'm
writing the body of the text here. It contains an overall description of the
project. It might explain how to go about installing/compiling it. It might
provide a change-log for the code. [[linalg]] Maybe it will talk about the
history and/or motivation for this software.
